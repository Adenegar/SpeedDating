The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment/home).\n\nData was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four minute \"first date\" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.\n\nThe dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include: demographics, dating habits, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate, and lifestyle information. See the attached Speed Dating Data Key document for details.\n\n**The aim of this project is two-fold: explanation and prediction**. In this project, we want to explore what people are looking for in their speed dating partners (attractive, sincere, intelligent, fun, ambitious or shared interests/hobbies), what it takes to get high scores from a potential partner and if any other factors (gender, age, same race etc.) influence peoples' decisions. \n\nThere are 8378 observations with 195 variables in the dataset. **The response we're focusing on is `like_o` which is the rating of how much a participant likes his/her speed-dating partner **and we believe this numerical value is a good measurement of a person's overall success in the speed dating experiment. \n\n- `like_o`: rate of like of speed-dating partner\n\n**And the predictors under consideration include: ** \n\n- `age_o`: age of speed-dating partner\n\n- `attr_o`: rate of attractiveness of speed-dating partner\n\n- `sinc_o`: rate of sincerity of speed-dating partner\n\n- `intel_o`: rate of intelligence of speed-dating partner\n\n- `fun_o`: rate of fun of speed-dating partner\n\n- `amb_o`: rate of ambition of speed-dating partner\n\n- `shar_o`: rate of shared interests of speed-dating partner\n\n- `gender`: gender of speed-dating partner, 0 stands for male and 1 stands for female\n\n- `samerace`: whether participant and partner were the same race, 0 stands for no and 1 stands for yes\n\n- `dec_o`: decision to see partner again, 0 stands for no and 1 stands for yes\n\n- `match`: a match occurs when both participant and partner check \"yes\" for decision\n\nOur purpose is to build a \"best\" model to explain and predict the relationship between the response and the predictors. We are looking for a linear model that is small and interpretable, but still fits the data well. Since what we have here in the speed dating experiment is observational data and with observational data, we can only detect associations.\n\nFor the purpose of explanation, our project will utilize the following concepts and strategies:\n\n- Multiple linear regression\n- Dummy variables\n- Assumption diagnostics\n- Collinearity\n- Outlier diagnostics\n- Interaction\n- Transformations\n- Polynomial regression\n- Model selection\n\nFor the purpose of prediction, this project will also apply the following concepts and strategies:\n\n- Test-Train Split\n- Residual diagnostics\n- Outlier diagnostics\n- Model selection\n\nThe `library` used in this project:\n\n- library(readr)\n\n- library(lmtest)\n\n- library(faraway)\n\n- library(MASS)\n\n- library(knitr)\n\n\n## Methods\n```{r}\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(lmtest)\nlibrary(faraway)\nlibrary(MASS)\nlibrary(knitr)\n```\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library(readr)\nlibrary(lmtest)\nlibrary(faraway)\nlibrary(MASS)\nlibrary(knitr)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.
