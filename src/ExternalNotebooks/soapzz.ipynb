Data was gathered from 552 participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. The attendees had four minute \"first date\" with every other participant of the opposite sex. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes. The dataset also includes questionnaire data about demographics, self-perception across key attributes, beliefs on what others find valuable in a mate and lifestyle information. \n\nMethodology: The data was filtered based on meaningful variables (see below) which are hypothesized to have an impact on a match. Because we want a full picture of an individuals preferences, rows with with NA values for questions that were not answered were dropped. Relationships and correlations between variables were investigated using heat maps, scatterplots, histograms and comparative plots.\n\nDescriptions of data: There are 8,378 rows/observations and 195 columns in total. After cleaning and filter, the data set has 2973 rows Ã— 31 columns. \n\nVariables include rankings for following attributes:\nAttractiveness\nSincerity\nIntelligence\nFun\nAmbition\nShared Interests\n\nPersonal information for:\ngender\nage\nincome\n\nQuestions I asked:\n\nWhich of the 6 variables are most important to people looking for a potential partner? \nDo matches change among

Conclusion\nIn this data analysis, we explored data from a speed dating analysis and looked at variables which may tell us what attributes people desire in a potential partner, and how the match making process differs across groups. Overall, only 16.5% of all participants found a match, which shows that find a date is not easy! It gets even harder as people get older, with proportion of matches over age 35 dropping steeply. \n\nA surprising finding is that women are less likely to find a match than men. But that is because women are much more picky than men and more likely to reject their date. \nPer popular belief, men tend to see attractiveness as the most important attribute in a partner, while for women it is intelligence. However, they are the top two attributes for both men and women. \n\nThese are the rankings of the 6 attributes according to gender: <br>\nFemale: Intelligence>Attractiveness>Sincerity>Fun>Ambition>Shared Interests <br>\nMale: Attractiveness>Intelligence>Fun>Sincerity>Shared Interests>Ambition\n\nWe can conclude from the data that oneâ€™s income does not significantly impact a personâ€™s chances of finding a match. The proportion of matches do not differ noticeably for those at the higher income levels. We can assume perhaps at least on the first few dates itâ€™s true, when it is hard to assess someoneâ€™s financial status. Again, when it comes to likeability, there is no noticeable impact for top earners; rich or poor, you can still have great (or lacklustre) appeal.\n\nFinally, when people say they want a partner with common interests, it is not necessarily reflected in their final decision. The data showed no distinct relationship between how highly shared interests are ranked by the participant and their decision to accept a date who shares their interests. Attributes are also correlated with each other; people who rate attractiveness as very important tend to also value fun more than intelligence, ambition, or sincerity. Logically, the more fun a person is the more likeable they are perceived, but when it comes to getting picked for a second date, being attractive still is a better predictor.\n\nIn general, the dataset showed a rather superficial view of the dating scene and supports the belief that good looks trumps personality a lot of the time. However keep in mind this is in the context of speed dating and may not translate directly to the longevity of a long term relationship. \n\n","metadata":{"id":"5lLsGPxaftfS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}}]}
